# School District Analysis

 # Overview of the School District Analysis
As a result of perceived academic dishonesty, specifically within **Thomas High School: 9th grade(Reading and Math scores)**, Maria(Supervisor) assigned me the task of altering the data so that the information for the standardized testing is correct. In order to complete my task, I needed to remove the ninth grade test results and then redo the entire analysis without the ninth grade reading and math scores. Lastly, I will present a report on how these changes affected the overall analysis.

#  Results
## How is the district summary affected?
- As seen below in figure 1, the the district preformed well with the higher reading and math scores,specifically, the *ninth grade scores*.

- As seen below in figure 2, as result of the ninth grade reading and math scores being removed, the overall district scores **decreased**. The overall score for the district decreased by less than a one percent.

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
- In this case, as a result of the score being removed, the ninth grade scores will be in last place. Or it cannot be commpared because the scores are removed. Either way the ninth grade scores of reading and math would be at the bottom of the rankings.

Scores by school spending
- With the ninth grade scores gone, its effect was not great enough to change the school spending position. It is still well position in it's category.

Scores by school size
