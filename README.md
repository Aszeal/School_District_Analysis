# School District Analysis

 ## Overview of the School District Analysis
As a result of perceived academic dishonesty, specifically within **Thomas High School: 9th grade(Reading and Math scores)**, Maria(Supervisor) assigned me the task of altering the data so that the information for the standardized testing is correct. In order to complete my task, I needed to remove the ninth grade test results and then redo the entire analysis without the ninth grade reading and math scores. Lastly, I will present a report on how these changes affected the overall analysis.
