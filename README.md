# School District Analysis

 # Overview of the School District Analysis
As a result of perceived academic dishonesty, specifically within **Thomas High School: 9th grade(Reading and Math scores)**, Maria(Supervisor) assigned me the task of altering the data so that the information for the standardized testing is correct. In order to complete my task, I needed to remove the ninth grade test results and then redo the entire analysis without the ninth grade reading and math scores. Lastly, I will present a report on how these changes affected the overall analysis.

#  Results
## How is the district summary affected?
- As seen below, the the district preformed well with the higher reading and math scores,specifically, the *ninth grade scores*.

- As seen below, as result of the ninth grade reading and math scores being removed, the overall district scores **decreased**. The overall score for the district decreased by less than a one percent.
